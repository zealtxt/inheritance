  <p>I don’t have any photos and I’m not sure if it counts as an object but my middle name is Fay, my mum’s middle name is Fay, my maternal grandma’s middle name was Fay, and her mother before that and so on. If I have a daughter in the future, her middle name will be Fay. I suppose you always hear about men naming their sons after themselves but not so much from the women. It’s something that ties me to my mother’s side of the family whilst using my father’s surname. It ensures that our history isn’t forgotten. We are not just partners of men, we are our own people and we have a lineage that is just as important. Some of the strongest people I’ve known are the women on my mother’s side of the family and so having the middle name I do is incredibly important to me. When I was younger I didn’t understand why we shared a middle name but now I do. It’s a thread that runs through our family tree rather than being cut off every time a woman changed her name to that of her husbands.
